Nicknames are non-empty strings with the following restrictions:

    They MUST NOT contain any of the following characters: 
            space (' ', 0x20), 
            comma (',', 0x2C), 
            asterisk ('*', 0x2A), 
            question mark ('?', 0x3F), 
            exclamation mark ('!', 0x21), 
            at sign ('@', 0x40).
    They MUST NOT start with any of the following characters: 
            dollar ('$', 0x24), 
            colon (':', 0x3A).
    They MUST NOT start with a character listed as a 
            channel type, 
            channel membership prefix, 
            or prefix listed in the IRCv3 multi-prefix Extension.



CHANNELS

The channel is created implicitly when the first client joins it, 
and the channel ceases to exist when the last client leaves it
Channel names are strings (beginning with specified prefix characters). 
Apart from the requirement of the first character being a valid channel type prefix character; 
the only restriction on a channel name is that it may not contain any 
        spaces (' ', 0x20), 
        a control G / BELL ('^G', 0x07), 
        or a comma (',', 0x2C) (which is used as a list item separator by the protocol).

To create a new channel or become part of an existing channel, a user is to use the JOIN command. 
 Command: JOIN
  Parameters: <channel>{,<channel>} [<key>{,<key>}]

Servers MUST process the parameters of this command as lists on incoming commands from clients,
with the first <key> being used for the first <channel>, the second <key> being used for the second <channel>, etc

f a client’s JOIN command to the server is successful, the server MUST send, in this order:

    A JOIN message with the client as the message <source> and the channel they have joined as the first parameter of the message.
    The channel’s topic (with RPL_TOPIC (332) and optionally RPL_TOPICWHOTIME (333)), and no message if the channel does not have a topic.
    A list of users currently joined to the channel (with one or more RPL_NAMREPLY (353) numerics followed by a single RPL_ENDOFNAMES (366) numeric). 
    These RPL_NAMREPLY messages sent by the server MUST include the requesting client that has just joined the channel.
